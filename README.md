# HR-Turnover-Analytics

Data is from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/lnvardanyan/hr-analytics). In this project, we want to figure out why employee want to leave a company, then company can retain more talents and make better human resource management strategies. So the target feature is left(1 is leave and 0 is stay). Obviously, this is a binary classification project.

It belongs to a new domain: People Analytics (PA). PA is a data-driven HR function recently emerged in worldâ€™s top high-tech companies. Starting from specific talent management questions, PA collects, integrates and analyzes data, and applies the result to human resource decision-making and practices.

As we all know, data science is powerful when it applies to different domains, such as Fintech, health analytics, NLP and so on. People analytics is a quite new domain and growing rapidly. It motivates me to learn more, find this dataset and try to figure out why employee want to leave a company. Finally I sucessfully achieve 98% accuracy.
